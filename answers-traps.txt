Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
    a1 and a2. a2 holds 13.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
    compiler has inlined f and g function call.

At what address is the function printf located?
    line:630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
    0x38

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output?
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
    HE110 World (because 57616 = 0xE110 and i = 0x00646c72 which will be 726c6400 = "ird/0")
    i need to change to "0x726c6400" and 57616 should not be changed


In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
    It depends on what value the a2 register have before printf is called.
